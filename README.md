# 🏀 AI-Generated Basketball Interview

This is a simple demonstration of how sports statistics can be transformed into a natural conversation using Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI audio tools. It is based on a dataset of a basketball team’s season statistics, where the model was asked to analyze performance and then generate a one-on-one interview script. To maintain neutrality, **all player names have been replaced with placeholders (Player A, Player B, etc.)**.

## 📂 Repository Contents
- **Interview_Script.pdf** – The interview script between an interviewer and the team coach.  
- **Interview_Audio.mp3** – The final audio version of the interview.  

## ⚙️ Tools & Workflow
The interview script was first generated using ChatGPT based on the basketball season dataset analysis. The audio was then produced by generating individual voice lines through [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/), and finally, the separate clips were combined and edited into a complete interview using [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/).  

## 🎯 Objective
- Show how AI can turn structured sports data into a conversational format.  
- Explore the pipeline: **dataset → LLM analysis → interview script → AI audio production**.  
- Provide a reproducible example for educational purposes.  

## Acknowledgement
This project was developed as part of a research based study and is intended for educational purposes only. The interview is entirely AI-generated and does not represent real individuals or real events.
